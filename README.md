# Longest Substring Finder
This Python project is designed to find the longest substring without repeating characters within a given string.


1) Run the longest_substring_finder.py file.
2) Enter a string when prompted.
3) The program will output the longest substring without repeating characters and its length.

## Example
```bash
python solution.py
input: ABCD
output: ABCD length: 4
```

# Algorithm Explanation

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. The algorithm uses a sliding window approach to find the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(min(n, m)) where n is the length of the input string and m is the size of the character set.
